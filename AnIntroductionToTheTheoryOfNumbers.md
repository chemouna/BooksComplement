- A prime number that is one less than a power of two is called a Mersenne prime. 
  For example, the prime number 31 is a Mersenne prime because it is 1 less than 32 (25).
  Similarly, a prime number (like 257) that is one more than a positive power of two is called 
  a Fermat prime—the exponent itself is a power of two. A fraction that has a power of two as its 
  denominator is called a dyadic rational. The numbers that can be represented as sums of consecutive 
  positive integers are called polite numbers; they are exactly the numbers that are not powers of two.
