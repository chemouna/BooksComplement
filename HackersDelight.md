## Infos
- An unsigned integer is a power of two if and only if it has exactly one 1 bit. 
- 2^n = 1 << n
- 2^n is the number of ways the bits in a binary word of length n can be arranged 
- binary representation of integers makes it possible to apply a very fast test to determine whether a given positive integer x is a power of two:
  positive x is a power of two <=> (x & (x âˆ’ 1)) is equal to zero.
